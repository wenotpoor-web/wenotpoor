      <p>
        I am not poor in resources.<br />
        I am poor only where I lack discipline.<br /><br />

        I will not confuse comfort with safety.<br />
        I will not confuse movement with progress.<br />
        I will not wait to be rescued.<br /><br />

        I accept that my results are my responsibility.<br />
        I accept that no explanation will save me.<br /><br />

        I do not join to belong.<br />
        I belong because I chose to act.<br /><br />

        From this point forward,<br />
        I stop asking who I could have been.<br /><br />

        <strong>I act as who I decided to be.</strong>

      <label class="check">
        <input type="checkbox" />
        I accept this without negotiation.
